# Chatbot Roadmap
***
## 1. Introduction
  Chatbots also called Conversational Agents or Dialog Systems.

  **A taxonomy of models: Retrieval-based Vs Generative Models**

  - Retrieval-based models(easier): use a repository of predefined responses and some kind of heuristic to pick an appropriate response based on the input and context. The heuristic could be as simple as a rule-based expression match, or as complex as an ensemble of Machine Learning classifiers. These systems don’t generate any new text, they just pick a response from a fixed set

  - Generative Models(harder): don’t rely on pre-defined responses. They generate new responses from scratch. Generative models are typically based on Machine Translation techniques, but instead of translating from one language to another, we “translate” from an input to an output (response).

## 2. Roadmap

  1. Artificial neural network
  1. back-propagation- BP
  1. Recurrent neural network (back propagation through time )
  1. Long Short Term Memory - Gated Recurrent Units
  1. One hot vector -> N-Grams, CBOW, Skip grams
